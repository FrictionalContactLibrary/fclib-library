coefficient of friction 0.8

number of problems 106

number of degrees of freedom [606]

number of contacts [14:578] 

required accuracy 1e-8

This set of 106 problems has been generated by LMGC90. It simulates the stacking of regular polyhedra.

todo : more details would be useful

The script that generates this example can be obtained from the Siconos development team. On the following figure,  distribution of the number of contacts, the number of d.o.f and the ratio number of contacts unknowns/number of d.o.f are illustrated.
