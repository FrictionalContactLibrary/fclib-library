coefficient of friction 0.8

number of problems 60

number of degrees of freedom 5700

number of contacts [2322:5037] 

required accuracy 1e-8

This set of 60 problems has been generated by LMGC90. It simulates the compression of two elactic cubes meshed by H8 finite elements.

todo : more details.

The script that generates this example can be obtained from the Siconos development team. On the following figure,  distribution of the number of contacts, the number of d.o.f and the ratio number of contacts unknowns/number of d.o.f are illustrated.
