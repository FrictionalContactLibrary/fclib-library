coefficient of friction 0.7

number of problems 249

number of degrees of freedom [6:300]

number of contacts [0:200]

required accuracy 1e-8

This set of 249 problems has been generated by Siconos with the help of Bullet contact detection library. It simulates 100 capsules dropped into a box. The Mass of each capsule is 1kg and length is 5m. The radius is 1m. The script that generates this example can be obtained from the Siconos development team. On the figure below, the distribution of the number of contacts, the number of d.o.f and the ratio number of contacts unknowns/number of d.o.f are illustrated.
