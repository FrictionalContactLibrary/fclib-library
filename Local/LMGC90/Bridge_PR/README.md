coefficient of friction 0.9, 1.15

number of problems 50

number of degrees of freedom [138]

number of contacts [70:108] 

required accuracy 1e-8

This set of 50 problems has been generated by LMGC90. It simulates the static equilibirum of an small unstabke bridge

todo : more details would be useful

The script that generates this example can be obtained from the Siconos development team. On the following figure,  distribution of the number of contacts, the number of d.o.f and the ratio number of contacts unknowns/number of d.o.f are illustrated.
